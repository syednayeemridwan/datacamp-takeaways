    "        - used as job or task queue\n",
    "        - used for asyncronous tasks (that needed to be happened soon)\n",
    "        - sending password reset emails, fulfill digital order etc\n",
    "        - allows for real-time processing for significant amount of messages\n",
    "        - provides functionality for management and scaling (vertical and horizontal)\n",
    "    - kafka\n",
    "        - distributed event-handling system (Batch processing)\n",
    "        - send events between producers and consumers\n",
    "        - Topics : Speial message format. Each topic only contain 1 type of event.\n",
    "        - Producers create events on a topic\n",
    "        - events on a topic created by producers are shared with consumers\n",
    "        - Consumer components receive the events and handle them accordingly\n",
    "        - Different consumers handles different events (logging, transformation, relaying etc)\n",
    "        - keep storeing events as long as storage capacity permits\n",
    "        - extremely powerful\n",
    "        - tricky to set up\n",
    "        - best used for passing data between multiple source and destination systems. Different complex data system architecture requires:\n",

    "            2. Change data capture (CDC)\n",

    "            4. Data system migrations\n",
    "    - spark streaming\n",
    "        - process streaming data (Streaming)\n",
    "        - Scala, Python , SQL\n",
    "        - useful for processing large amount of data and machine learning\n",
    "        - transition from batch to stream processing is possible\n",

    "- Things to Include:\n",
    "    - What significant visualizations to include?\n",
    "        - Too many would be distracting\n",
    "    - Is the most intuitive visual being used?\n",
    "        - Does the audience understand the visual, do you need time to explain the visual\n",
    "    - Are we sizing, positioning, & coloring visuals relative to their importance?\n",
    "        - Draw attention to key areas that solves the problem\n",
    "- Best Practices:\n",
    "    - Less is more (Do not overwhelm with little information, instead make them focused with key information)\n",
    "    - Give numbers context (good or bad)\n",
    "    - Label everything\n",
    "    - Make interactive (so that clients can explore the data)"
